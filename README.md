# Drought_SDI_Bangladesh

This repository helps to calculate a more comprehensive drought index called Vegetation-Temperature-Precipitation Condition Index which is popularly known as Synthesized Drought Index (SDI) to monitor drought condition at a monthly time-step. MODIS LST, NDVI and Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation products have been used in SDI calculation which gives a proper idea of precipitation deficits, soil thermal stress and vegetation growth status in drought process. Therefore, this method contributes to the understanding of drought in a comprehensive way.
